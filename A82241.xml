            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DECLARATION <hi>OF</hi> The Common-councell men of the City of <hi>London,</hi> within the Ward of <hi>Walbrook,</hi> ſetting forth the great injuſtice, and oppreſſion of theſe preſent times, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>VVHereas by order of the late Lord Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor and Commiſſioners, a precept came to the Deputy and Common-councell men of the Ward of <hi>Walbrook,</hi> requiring them to call tr their aſſiſtance, ſuch able perſons as they ſhall think meet, to aſſeſs upon the Inhabitants of their Ward, the ſum of 50. l. which was in arrears of the 4. former aſſeſments of the 12, 10, 6, &amp; 4 months, for the L. Gen. <hi>Fairfax</hi> his army, the Common counſell men in obedience to that precept, did call to aſſiſtance 8. other perſons Inhabitants in their Ward, for the more equal rating and aſſeſſing of the aforeſaid ſum, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long and ſerious conſultation and debate, did finde that the reall eſtates, <hi>viz,</hi> the Rents of houſes had not
<pb facs="tcp:117209:3"/>been rated at all, or not conſiderable in thoſe 4 aſſeſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; did therefore adjudge it, to be juſt to lay ſome conſiderable part of the 500. l. upon the aforeſaid Rents, and they alſo finding that the Aſſeſſors in thoſe 4 aſſeſments, had exceeding overrated the poor people of ſmall eſtates, and alſo had exceedingly under rated themſelves, and the men of great Eſtates in the Ward. The now Common councell men finding this great partiality and inequality, did judge it juſt before God, and all juſt men, to lay the greateſt part of that which remained and not laid on the real eſtates, upon thoſe of great eſtates that had bin ſo much under-rated, that if the rich men had bin rated, proportionably to thoſe of ſmall eſtates, there would have bin little or none of thoſe arrears, judging it very unjuſt and contrary to Gods command, to add oppreſſion to oppreſſion, alſo contrary to the true intent and meaning of the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of parl. Having taken this courſe for the more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy getting in of the aforeſaid arrears, &amp; alſo to prevent future arrears, did finiſh the books, and according to order ſent them in. But upon the complaint of ſome of the Ward, together with ſuch of the Comoncoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel as were aſſeſſors of thoſe unequal aſſeſments, to the Lord Mayor and Commiſ. We the now aſſeſſors were ſent for before them, and notwithſtanding we made it clear to the commiſ. that we had ſo aſſeſſed it as was moſt agreeable to Gods command to take of heavy burdens, &amp; to relieve the oppreſſed, which we alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared was the true intent and meaning of the Ordi. of parl. &amp; alſo diſcharge our truſt; yet were we overaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and commanded to take the book &amp; alter it, to take off from the rich, and to lay it on ſuch as wee knew to be over-rated before, and yet had paid which we judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unreaſonable, we alſo told the Aldermen, that their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117209:3"/>evill example in rating themſelves ſo low in every aſſeſment did occaſion that no rich men in any Ward, would be rated proportionably to the eſtates, &amp; did plead &amp; do ſin plead that an Alderman was but ſo much, &amp; ſhould they be rated equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with, or more then an Ald. We alſo told them that we did expect that as it was their duty, ſo they would have given us in command all the aſſeſſors of every Ward in London, to have conſidered ſuch as had bin over-rated to have eaſed them, &amp; alſo ſuch as had been under-rated, to have laid the more on them. This was much ſtood upon, and by ſome anſwred with bitter expreſſions, and angry countenances; but our concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was with them thus. That we did hope in the ſincerity of our hearts we had obeyed Gods command, in taking off hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy burdens, and in relieving of ſome of the oppreſſed, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting others that were more oppreſſed go free, and that if they (the Commiſſioners) did ſay thoſe burdens on again, the ſin ſhould lie at their doors, and they ſhould anſwer for it, we had diſcharged our truſt. We know it to be juſt, that he that is worth 1000. l. ſhould be rated ten times ſo much as hee that is worth 100. l. and ſo proportionably from the leaſt eſtate to the greateſt, and he that hath the greateſt eſtate hath the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt advantage by this Rule of proportion, and if the Wards men be wiſe in their elections of common-councell men, let them look upon ſuch as are godly, wiſe men, of the middle rank of men, and make choice of ſuch men they will find wil act moſt and beſt for them and the publique. What injuſtice, unequality; and oppreſſion hath bin uſed and exerciſed upon the poor and men of ſmall eſtates in all former aſſeſments the like hath been in a great meaſure in every Ward in levying men and armes to attend their Captains and Commanders in the Trayned Bands, as an Alderman, or great rich man to ſend three men and peradventure ſends but one, it may be none at all; when a poor man of ſmall eſtate ſhall go forth, and find his own armes; this is alſo a great injuſtice and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>

                  <p>THe Earl of Brainford hath had audience, with the moſt high and mighty Princeſſe the Queen of Sweden, and hath given an account to his young maſter the Prince, of the repreſenting his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie to her Majeſty, purporting, That there are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of great conſequence, to be maturely debated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be an Army of Zwitzers obtained, which gives a great demur to the new Game in agitation; ſo that if their Cards be not well plaid upon the firſt lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the Game is in great halard of being utterly loſt and fruſtrated in the concluſion. And the rather, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the uniting of the two moſt famous and renow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> which in all probability will ſoon be made manifeſt to all Chriſtian princes, thorow out their ſeverall Teritories: For the moſt illuſtrious Queen of Sweden, hath declared prince <hi>Charles</hi> pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, &amp;c.
